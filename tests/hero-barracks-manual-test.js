/**
 * Manual Test for Hero Movement Speed and Barracks Tower Rally Point
 * 
 * This file contains instructions for manually testing the implemented changes:
 * 1. Hero speed increased by 40% (from 80 to 112)
 * 2. Barracks Tower units have clickable rally point with visual indicators
 */

/**
 * TEST 1: Hero Movement Speed Increased by 40%
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Open the game at http://localhost:3000
 * 2. Observe the initial hero position
 * 3. Click on the hero to select it (should see a white selection circle)
 * 4. Click on a distant location on the map to set a gather point
 * 5. Observe how quickly the hero moves to that location
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - The hero should move 40% faster than before
 * - You should see a visual indicator (dotted line) from hero to destination
 * - The hero should be automatically deselected after clicking the destination
 */

/**
 * TEST 2: Barracks Tower Rally Point Setting
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Select a tower placement spot and build a barracks tower
 * 2. Click on the barracks tower to select it
 * 3. Click the "Set Gather Point" button in the tower menu
 * 4. Click on a location on the map to set the rally point
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - The soldiers from the barracks tower should move to the new rally point
 * - You should see visual indicators (dotted lines) from soldiers to their destinations
 * - The soldiers should be properly offset from each other at the rally point
 * - The rally point setting mode should exit after clicking
 */

/**
 * Verification via Browser Console
 * 
 * You can use these console commands to verify the changes:
 *
 * 1. Verify hero speed:
 *    console.log(window.game.heroManager.heroes[0].speed);
 *    // Should output 112 (80 * 1.4)
 *
 * 2. Check that barracks tower soldiers have target indicators:
 *    const tower = window.game.towerManager.towers.find(t => t.type === "barracks tower");
 *    console.log(tower.unitGroup.units.map(u => ({ 
 *      hasTarget: !!u.showTarget, 
 *      targetX: u.targetX, 
 *      targetY: u.targetY 
 *    })));
 *    // Should show target information for all soldiers
