/**
 * Manual Test Script for TABSH Game
 * 
 * This file contains instructions for manually testing the implemented features:
 * 1. Level 1 waves fix
 * 2. Barracks tower unit triangle formation and movement
 */

/**
 * TEST 1: Level 1 Waves Fix
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Start the server: node server.js
 * 2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
 * 3. Make sure Level 1 is selected (the default)
 * 4. Open browser developer console and run:
 *    console.log(window.game.waveManager.waves);
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - The console should show an array of 3 waves
 * - Each wave should have "enemyGroups" array with enemy definitions
 * 
 * 5. Click the "Start" button in the game
 * 6. Wait for a few seconds
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Enemies should start spawning and moving along the paths
 * - First wave should have 5 drone enemies
 * - You can verify by running in console:
 *   console.log(window.game.enemies);

/**
 * TEST 2: Barracks Tower Unit Triangle Formation
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Start a new game or restart the current one
 * 2. Click on a tower spot and build a barracks tower
 * 3. Observe the soldiers from the tower
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Soldiers should be positioned in a triangle/circular formation
 * - They should be placed near the closest path
 * - Target indicators should show their rally points
 * 
 * 4. Click on the barracks tower to select it
 * 5. Click the "Set Gather Point" button
 * 6. Click somewhere else on the map to set a new rally point
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Soldiers should move to the new location
 * - They should maintain their triangle formation around the new point
 * - Target lines should be visible showing their movement paths
 * 
 * Check via Console:
 * Run the following in the browser console to verify:
 * 
 * 1. Check the tower soldiers' positions and formation:
 *    const tower = window.game.towerManager.towers.find(t => t.type === "barracks tower");
 *    console.log("Soldier formation:", tower.unitGroup.offsets);
 *    console.log("Soldier positions:", tower.unitGroup.units.map(u => ({ 
 *      x: u.x, 
 *      y: u.y, 
 *      gatherX: u.gatherX, 
 *      gatherY: u.gatherY 
 *    })));
 * 
 * 2. Check if they're using the closest path initially:
 *    console.log("Tower position:", { x: tower.x, y: tower.y });
 *    console.log("Rally point:", { x: tower.unitGroup.gatherX, y: tower.unitGroup.gatherY });
 */
