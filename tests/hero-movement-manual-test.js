/**
 * Manual test script for hero movement functionality
 * 
 * This script provides a step-by-step procedure to manually test hero movement
 * in the TABSH game.
 */

/**
 * Test: Hero movement before game starts
 * Steps:
 * 1. Open http://localhost:3000/
 * 2. Select a hero (Archer or Knight)
 * 3. Click on Level 1
 * 4. Once the level loads, click on the blue hero dot to select it
 * 5. Click anywhere else on the gameboard
 * 
 * Expected results:
 * - The hero should be deselected after clicking elsewhere
 * - The hero should move to the clicked location
 * - This movement should work before clicking the Start button
 * 
 * Console Logs to expect:
 * - "Setting gather point for hero [name] to [x] [y]"
 * - "Hero gather point set to: [x] [y]"
 * - Movement-related logs showing the hero changing position

/**
 * Test: Hero deselection after movement command
 * Steps:

 * 2. Select a hero (Archer or Knight)
 * 3. Click on Level 1
 * 4. Once the level loads, click on the blue hero dot to select it
 * 5. Verify the hero is selected (it should have a white outline)
 * 6. Click anywhere else on the gameboard

 * - The hero should be deselected immediately after clicking
 * - Clicking elsewhere on the map should not cause the hero to move again
 * - You should be able to click on other UI elements without affecting hero movement
